The key features are:

* **Type hints**: All methods provided by PyPaystack2 are type annotated, so you can infer. This improves the
  development experience.
* **Async support**: PyPaystack2 allow you to also make calls to Paystack API using `async/await` which is super great,
  for example, if your project is in [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) where every chance of a performance
  improvement adds up.
